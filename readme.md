# Say hello to Annie ğŸ‘‹
Annie is a utility module written for the Defold game engine that provides some basic functions to make working with atlases that contain animation groups that consist of 2D sprites with differing uniform dimensions easier to align.

The main utilities of Annie are:
- basic animation switch for lightweight integration into responsive logic in your `update()` (Annie doesn't send the `'play_animation'` message if already playing the animation)
- ability to bypass the animation switch, to force a replay of the current animation
- automatic alignment of the parent gameobject on playing an animation
- ability to lock and unlock animations
- ability to retain the cursor position between different animations

Currently Annie's main purpose is to assist with aligning the animation groups to each other.

# Usage

## 1. Installation

To get started with Annie, assign her install function in the `init()` of a script component.

```lua
local annie = require 'annie.annie'

function init(self)
    self.annie = annie.install([animation_set], [data])
end
```

The Annie instance is returned as a table that has some important values:
```lua
annie = {
    objects = {},
    sprites = {},
    animation_set = animation_set 
	current_animation = ''
    last_animation = ''
	locked = false
	linked_timers = {}
    cursor = 0
    -- API functions not listed here, but this is where they live
}
```

Both parameters of the install function are optional. Excluding them from your call will disable Annie's auto-alignment utility.

The `animation_set` parameter is used internally as a key for a value lookup that corresponds to your hardcoded animation data.
Annie looks for a value that matches your `animation_set` from a table within Annie's module with the key `'data'`.
You can override this internal lookup and provide the Annie instance being installed with it's own *unique* data with the `data` parameter of the install function.

Your animation data for Annie should be a table that follows this structure:
```lua
{
    arbitrary_readable_name = { -- this is what Annie looks for with the animation_set parameter
        animation = { -- this key needs to match the animation_id in the atlas
            0, --> in pixels, the X value that Annie will set the position of linked objects to (offset)
            0, --> in pixels, the Y value that Annie will set the position of linked objects to (offset)
            keep_cursor = {} --> optional field containing strings that match animation_ids in the atlas
        }
    },

    another_animation_set = {
        my_animation = {
            0,
            0        
        },
        another_animation = {
            0,
            0,
            keep_cursor = {'my_animation'}
        }
    },

    -- etc.
}
```
For large projects where atlases contain numerous animation groups, or a larger number of distinct objects need to have Annie installed, the follow procedure to manage your animation data is recommended:
>Serialize your animation sets into separate files and either
>1. write a deserializer that consolidates them into a single table to feed into Annie at runtime
>2. or require the relevant file in the script installing Annie, then pass the data into the `data` parameter

## 2. Implementing Annie

Annie tries not to assume what specific skills of hers that you need, and her features are compartmentalized where possible. To make customization of Annie's usage possible, many of her utilities are exposed and it is up to you to implement them.

### 2a. Linking gameobjects and sprites to Annie
***
An installed Annie instance needs to know which gameobjects she should worry about. Usually, it makes sense for your main script to be attached to a 'primary' gameobject for which the main positional updates are handled through. A 'display' gameobject that is a child to this 'primary' gameobject can then be used to handle the offsets for sprites with non-uniform animation dimensions. This 'display' gameobject is the gameobject that should be linked to Annie.

*Very important:*
>Currently, Annie understands each linked gameobject as only having a single sprite component. Please keep this limitation in mind.

To link a single gameobject-sprite pair to Annie:
```lua
self.annie.link('display', '#my_sprite')
```
The first parameter is a `urlstring` passed to `msg.url()` internally.
The second parameter is concatenated to the first parameter, then passed to `msg.url()` internally.
Annie stores the returns of these calls in order to know which gameobjects her internal function calls should affect.
If no second parameter is provided, `'#sprite'` is used by default.

There is also an alternative link function that condenses linking multiple gameobject-sprite pairs into a single call.

If all of your sprites would be represented by the `urlstring` fragment `'#sprite'`:
```lua
self.annie.mlink('a','b','c') -- accepts variable number of parameters
```
This will link gameobjects `a`, `b`, and `c` to Annie, assuming they each have a sprite component named `'sprite'`.

To specify specific sprite names for each gameobject, provide a table:
```lua
self.annie.mlink({
    a = '#some_sprite',
    b = '#another_sprite',
    c = '#sprite_again'
})
```

### 2b. Customizing the `annie.play()` function
***
*Important note:*
>Annie cannot track external changes to relevant factors of her functionality by herself. Annie is meant to be an easy and intuitive replacement for common calls (and their surrounding logic) such as:
>- `msg.post(url, 'play_animation', { id = hash(animation) })`
>- `sprite.play_flipbook(url, hash(animation))`
>
>Using these calls without informing Annie could introduce hard to find bugs if you treat Annie's utilities as a black box, so try not to use them when you've already got Annie in your script! If you still need to use them, make sure to keep your Annie instance updated.

To make Annie's replacement of the above calls intuitive and simple, Annie has a predefined dummy function `annie.play()` that is meant to be overwritten to include Annie's utilities on a per-instance basis. The default function uses only Annie's `annie.play_anim()` utility:
```lua
function annie.play(animation, mode, ...)
    annie.play_anim(animation, mode, ...)
end
```
A common utility that you may need to add to the function is Annie's ability to flip one or both of the offsets from your animation data.

For example, it would be useful if you had an object where you've offset the animation on the X axis, and the object can face either left or right. When the object changes the direction it faces, you would need to flip the offsets to keep it aligned to the origin of the parent gameobject by the same factors when mirrored.

To add this functionality, simply overwrite the `annie.play()` function and add it in after Annie's installation:
```lua
local annie = require 'annie.annie'

function init(self)
    self.annie = annie.install([animation_set], [data])
    
    function self.annie.play(animation, mode, ...)
        self.annie.play_anim(animation, mode, ...)
        self.annie.flip_offset([flip_x], [flip_y])
    end
end
```
You could also ignore this dummy function and access the utilities with your own external function wrappers if that makes more sense for your use case (inclusion of utilities based on game state, for example). However, if you do this `annie.lock()` and `annie.unlock()` cannot be used for their secondary function of playing an animation while locking/unlocking the instance. See the API reference for a usage explanation of `.flip_offset()` and more of Annie's utilities.

## 3. Locking and unlocking the Annie instance
***
It is possible to 'lock' the instance, preventing the internal state from being changed and disabling the ability to play animations altogether:
```lua
self.annie.lock()
self.annie.unlock()
```
This is useful if you want to integrate the state of the instance into your game logic.

Both functions will also attempt to call `annie.play()`, useful for keeping your code compact!

## 4. Features around `animation_done`
***
To make use of built-in utilities that have to do with the `animation_done` message, add `annie.animation_done()` to your script's `on_message()`:
```lua
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
    if message_id == hash('animation_done') then
        self.annie.animation_done()
    end
end
```

Sometimes, you may want to link timers to your animation so that they can be cancelled when the animation is finished. Annie provides a place to store timer handles and a method to cancel them through the Annie instance, which could make it easier to manage and keep track of depending on your use case:
```lua
local my_timer = timer.delay(1, false, function() print('I\'m a linked timer!') end)
self.annie.add_linked_timer(my_timer)
```

By default, `annie.animation_done()` also unlocks the instance.
Either behaviour can be removed or replaced by overwriting the function.

# To-Do

- Improve internal functions to allow Annie to affect gameobjects with multiple sprite components.
- Add functionality for a separate alignment relative to the grandparent gameobject.
- Decouple the alignment structure and expose it in a way that makes advanced usage intuitive.
